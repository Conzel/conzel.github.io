I am Alexander Conzelmann and currently pursuing a PhD in the group of [Robert Bamler](https://robamler.github.io) at the University of Tübingen.
My main research interest is data compression using cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

I created this page to [showcase some of my favorite projects](/projects) – the goal
is always to write clean, elegant and highly performant code demonstrating some interesting techniques. All my work can 
be found on my GitHub page. I am also a huge Open Source proponent and programming language fan (currently enarmored with Rust).
Besides programming, I love dancing, cooking and playing chess.

If you want to get in touch, don't hesitate to write me an e-mail!
