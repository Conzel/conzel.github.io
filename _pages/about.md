title: "About me"

I am Alexander Conzelmann and currently working on my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Tübingen.
My favorite topics are Software Engineering and Machine Learning – and especially the marriage of them is 
challenging and promising at the same time. I created this page to [showcase some of my favorite projects](/projects) – the goal
is always to write clean, elegant and highly performant code demonstrating some interesting techniques. All my work can 
be found on my GitHub page. I am also a huge Open Source proponent, programming language fan (currently enarmored with Rust) and active in the Linux community. 
Maybe we'll see each other at a local meetup :) Besides programming, I love dancing, cooking, chess and playing the piano.

If you want to get in touch, don't hesitate to write me an e-mail!
