title: About me
---
I am Alexander Conzelmann and currently pursuing a PhD under the supervision of [Shiwei Liu](https://shiweiliuiiiiiii.github.io) at the University of Tübingen. Previously, I completed a B.Sc in Nano-Science and a M.Sc. in Computer Science in Tübingen. I also worked as a software engineer for Bosch on self-driving cars and as an applied scientist for Amazon AWS in inference optimization.

My main research interest is making machine learning more efficient and accessible, using techniques such as quantization, entropy coding and pruning. 

In my free time, I enjoy photography and cooking, and I compete in Latin American dancing, where I am currently placed in the highest national class.

If you want to get in touch, don't hesitate to write me an e-mail!
